            <p>Whether it's Audi Q7 or BMW X7 or Maruti S Presso or Kia Seltos HTK Plus, people look at the vehicle not by the price paid, its power or its features, but the first question asked is <b>Kitna deti hai?</b> or what is the mileage? The mind-set holds well with the young learners who are judged by their score, grade points secured by them and which number they stand in a class of 40.</p>
            <!-- <h3>We make creativity work for your brand!</h3> -->
            <p id="textContent" style="display: none;">Hardly anyone looks at the student's potential or the skill sets that he possess. We must understand that the learning approach <b>“is as unique as every learner”.</b> One learner may grasp quickly, while the other has challenge in grasping and understanding. If one can recall what is taught in a jiffy, the other could forget what is taught in no time. A parent feels the ward has difficulty in paying attention, the other would say their ward has such hard time learning maths, or it is so much challenging to get the ward to read or practise or even accuse the teacher. Parents expect the moon and crib for small things about their ward, that he/she is not performing to the true potential or has difficulty in keeping track of time or not good at problem solving skills or cannot organise and plan nor can multi task. The crib can be endless and in plenty. Little do they realise that they should seek advice of a good counsellor? We have been asked by many a parents as to what support we provide for students who are weak in their studies. SURE PASS initiative was started to meet this expectation of parents and students and we are happy that we have been very successful in helping 100s of students to PASS all their subjects leaving no back paper at the end of the year. Our support is available to students at every level, 'KG to PG'.</p>

            <h6>Counselling</h6>
            <p>Counselling is a process when an assessee and a counselor agree to set aside time to explore assesses queries, concerns and difficulties</p>
            <p id="Content1" style="display: none;">which may include guidance, hand holding, fear, stress, frustration, trauma or emotional feelings etc., For students it may also include guidance to score high, focus in studies, choose the right career stream, choose the right branch, choose the right job and helping one to prepare for the job by building the right work skills etc., This frank discussion can enable the assessee to focus on feelings, experiences or behaviors, a goal of facilitating positive change or result.  Counselling varies from person to person with a minimum 45 minutes to 90 minutes per sitting. The engagement could be just one time or could span over 2 or more sittings.
